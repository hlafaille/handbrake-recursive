# handbrake-recursive
A basic tool for recursively encoding video files using Handbrake. Simply point it to a directory and the tool will do the rest. This tool is a little rough around the edges, as I really just needed to get it working to run a task overnight. I will be polishing it up as I think it could be a very useful tool for those in the Handbrake community.
